# Rivals Camera Stabilizer

This program takes Rivals of Aether footage and stabilizes the in-game camera. This can make it easier for editors to automate their own camera work. It may also serve as a preprocessing step for other computer vision or AI work. 

Many thanks to phantomphreak127 for his contributions to this project!

## Instructions

Under releases, download RivalsCameraStabilize-Standalone.zip. Unzip it and run RivalsCameraStabilizer.exe, at which point you can provide your video file. The program handles most video formats as inputs, and produces MP4s. You can also download example.zip to see an example of stabilized footage.

If the application doesn't immediately work for you, you may need to install the proper codecs. Install ffmpeg using this tutorial: https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows
