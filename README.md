# Rivals Camera Stabilizer

This program takes Rivals of Aether footage and stabilizes the in-game camera. This can make it easier for editors to automate their own camera work. It may also serve as a preprocessing step for other computer vision or AI work. 

Many thanks to phantomphreak127 for his contributions to this project!
